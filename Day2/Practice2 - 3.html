    <p  title="Dish Introduction">Masvadi is a traditional Maharashtrian dish from Pune, Maharashtra. It consists of a spicy stuffing made from onions, coconut, peanuts, sesame seeds, and spices like garam masala and garlic1. This stuffing is then wrapped in a layer of steamed gram flour (besan) dough and rolled into cylindrical shapes. The rolls are cut into pieces and typically served with a spicy curry (rassa) and flatbread like roti or bhakri1.</p>
