    <p  title="Dish Introduction">Misal Pav is a popular Maharashtrian street food from Maharashtra, India. It consists of a spicy curry made from sprouted lentils (usually moth beans) called usal, served with pav (soft bread rolls). The dish is topped with farsan (fried savory mixture), chopped onions, lemon juice, and coriander leaves1. It's typically enjoyed hot and can be served as breakfast, a snack, or even a full meal.</p>
